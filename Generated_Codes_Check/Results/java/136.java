Explanation

For query 1, the numbers lying between indices 2 and 2 are 2,3. Since they are divisible by 2 we divide them by 2.
For query 2, the numbers lying between indices 2 and 2 are 2,3. Since they are divisible by 2 we divide them by 2.
For query 3, the number at index 2 is modified to 3.
For query 4, the numbers lying between indices 2 and 3 are 3 and 5. Since they are divisible by 3 we divide them by 3.
